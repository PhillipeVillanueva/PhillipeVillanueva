        Thiss us my favourite and also my most difficult lesson because I finally
        get to code and create my own website which I got excited from and I actually
        enjoy despite the difficulties and headaches I had to go through. It really
        gave me the feeling of fulfillment I couldn't achieve from anything other than comics.
